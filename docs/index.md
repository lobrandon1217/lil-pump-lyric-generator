## Welcome to Lyric Pump

This is the future of songwriting and social media, all in one package.

We use a markov chain to get the probabilities of each word occurring after another and use that to our advantage.

We also use a MySQL to store information, so you can log in, register, and submit songs and even give other people feedback on their songs as well.

Do you have writer's block? Don't know what song to write?
We have you covered. Using our program, we guarantee that you will create the next top hits.
